# Project Overview

Dataset obtained from Healthy Lifestyle Cities Report 2021 where the team at Lenstore has analysed **44 cities** across the globe to uncover where itâ€™s easier to lead a well-rounded, healthy lifestyle. From obesity levels to pollution rates, each city has been scored **across 10 healthy living metrics.**

I am interested in the **Happiness Level** variable here, whether it is influenced more by variables that affect mental or physical health, so the target question is **which variables will have an influence on the Happiness Level of a city.**

# Insight

After understanding the data and analyze the key importances; I noticed these are the top 3 cities with high Happiness Levels as well as high indexes to fit the condition of cities with healthy lifestyles.

The analysis shows that **cities with high Happiness Levels** often have the outstanding characteristics of healthy lifestyles: **high average life expectancy, low pollution levels, short working hours, and sometimes moderate or lower sunshine hours.**

Among the three happiest cities, Helsinki, Geneva, and Zurich, there is a notable difference. Although Helsinki has the highest happiness index, it is not the top city for healthy living. Similarly, Geneva and Zurich, although having the same happiness index, have significantly different rankings for healthy living (Geneva is ranked 20th, while Zurich is ranked 30th). This suggests that **happiness is not solely dependent on factors related to physical health.**

This result emphasizes that, **although a healthy lifestyle plays an important role in improving quality of life, it is not the only factor that determines happiness.** Other factors such as community connection, personal freedom, culture, and mental health also contribute to satisfaction and happiness. This encourages a balanced approach, combining physical and mental aspects of health, to achieve overall happiness.
